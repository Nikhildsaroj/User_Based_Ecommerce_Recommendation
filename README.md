# User_Based_Ecommerce_Recommendation

## E-commerce Product Recommendation System

This project implements a user-based recommendation system for eCommerce using collaborative filtering techniques. The primary goal is to enhance the shopping experience by recommending products tailored to individual users based on the purchasing behaviors of similar users. By analyzing patterns in user transactions and preferences, the system identifies correlations between users to deliver personalized product suggestions.

## Key Features
- **User-Based Recommendations:** Products are recommended based on purchases made by similar users.
- **KMeans Clustering:** Users are clustered by Age, Gender, Location, and Interests to enhance recommendations.
- **Data Visualization & EDA:** Exploratory data analysis was conducted to identify trends in demographics and purchase frequency.
- **Model Testing:** Collaborative filtering is applied within each user cluster for tailored recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

### Libraries:
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn:** For implementing clustering and filtering algorithms.
- **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
- **Seaborn:** For enhanced visualizations.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection:** Gather user transaction data and relevant features.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data to ensure quality and integrity.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze trends in demographics and purchase frequency to inform the recommendation strategy.
4. **Clustering:** Apply KMeans clustering to segment users based on demographic information.
5. **Recommendation Generation:** Use collaborative filtering techniques within each user cluster to provide personalized product recommendations.
6. **Visualization:** Display key findings and recommendations using visualizations.
